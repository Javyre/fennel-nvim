FENNEL RUNTIME						*fennel-version*
	This plugin is currently running fennel `0.4.0-dev`, in a state
	currently only slightly ahead of 0.3.0. It should be identical to
	fennel 0.3.0 with the exception of a couple of minor bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE							*fennel-usage*

COMMANDS						*fennel-commands*

:[range]Fnl {chunk}					*:Fnl*

	Analog of `:lua`. Execute Fennel chunk. Range is allowed, but ignored.
	Return values that can't exist in viml will be replaced with `nil`.

:[range]FnlFile {file}					*:FnlFile*

	Analog of `:luafile`. Execute script {file} in Fennel. File arg is required. For example, to
	execute the current file when editing a Fennel script: >
		:FnlFile %
<

:[range]FnlDo {body}					*:FnlDo*
	Fennel analog of `:luado`.
	Executes the Fennel function "(fn [line linenr] {body})" for each line
	in [range], with the text of each line passed without the trailing
	<EOL>. If the return value of the function is text, it will be set as
	the new contents of that line.


COMPLETION 						*fennel-completion*
	fennel-nvim comes with functions that can be used with vim's built-in
	|omnifunc| or plugged into various completion plugins. These will
	complete on globals in neovim's Lua environment (including the
	|lua-api|) as well as Fennel's global macros and specials.

	*fnl#omniComplete* and *fnl#omniCompleteLua* are exposed as
	vimscript functions. The only difference is that {fnl#omniCompleteLua}
	doesn't include macros or specials. Example: >
		:setlocal omnifunc=fnl#omniComplete
<
	For neovim lua/fnl projects, I generally just set this form an `.exrc` file,
	but you can set it how you like. They can also be worked with from
	Fennel directly using `(require :fennel-nvim.complete)`, but there is
	not yet a lua api for this, as the completion is written in fennel and
	not (yet) precompiled, so |g:fennel_nvim_patch_searchers| can't be
	disabled.

INIT.FNL						*fennel-init*

	When *init.fnl* is found within a config dir (see `stdpath()`), it
	will be automatically sourced. This can be disabled by setting
	`g:fennel_auto_init` to false (see |fennel-config|).
	Note: in future versions, it may only auto-source if no `init.vim
	is present.


CONFIGURATION 						*fennel-config*

*g:fennel_nvim_auto_init*
	Default: `v:true`. If set to false, will prevent fennel-nvim from auto-sourcing
	`init.fnl`. See |fennel-init|.

*g:fennel_nvim_patch_searchers*
	When set to true (default), `fennel.searcher` will be added to `package.loaders`
	in neovim's luajit environment (see |lua-require|). This will allow
	calls to `require` from Lua to also load and run any available Fennel
	modules.

FENNEL PATHS 						*fennel-paths*
*fennel.path*						*fennel-runtimepath*
	The same way neovim automatically updates `package.path` with values
	from `runtimepath`, fennel-nvim will check for changes to
	`package.path` and update *fennel.path* with transformed equivalents.
	Paths ending in `.lua` will be translated to `.fnl`
	`lua/?.lua` to `fnl/?.fnl`, and `lua/?/init.lua` to `fnl/?/init.fnl`.
